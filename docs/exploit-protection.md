\# Exploit Protection Strategy



\## Objective

This document describes the rationale behind the current exploit protection

configuration and the decision to rely on system defaults.



\## Current State

System-wide exploit mitigations are configured using Windows default settings.



This includes:

\- DEP

\- ASLR

\- CFG

\- SEHOP

\- Heap protections



No explicit overrides are applied at this time.



\## Rationale

The baseline prioritizes:

\- Platform integrity

\- Code execution prevention

\- Hardware-backed trust



Exploit protection hardening is intentionally deferred to avoid:

\- Application compatibility issues

\- Increased operational complexity

\- False sense of security without proper testing



\## Risk Consideration

Relying on system defaults accepts residual risk related to:

\- Memory corruption exploits in trusted applications

\- Post-exploitation techniques within allowed binaries



These risks are partially mitigated by:

\- Hypervisor-enforced code integrity (HVCI)

\- Application control (WDAC)

\- Attack Surface Reduction rules



\## Future Hardening Path

Exploit protection may be incrementally hardened by:

\- Enabling system-wide DEP and ASLR enforcement

\- Applying per-process mitigations for high-risk applications

\- Auditing exploit mitigation impact before enforcement



\## Architectural Position

Exploit protection is treated as a secondary containment layer,

not as a primary security boundary.
